# C++ Random Particle Generator (RPG)

## Description

RPG is an OpenGL application that displays a single particle emitter which can be modified in real time by the user. The primary form of modification will be through changing the internal pseudo random number generator that determines how the direction and force of each particle is distributed.

This project is inspired by the particle generator example from [OpenGL-Tutorial](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/intermediate-tutorials/billboards-particles/particles-instancing/) but will built from scratch.

Depending on how this project progresses, it may be factored into several libraries for later reuse. 

## Goals

The primary purpose of this application is to improve my familiarity with the following topics:

1. CMake
2. GCC
3. MinGW and Cygwin
4. OpenGL
5. C++ 2020

## Build Instructions

Will be formalized once version 1.0 is complete.
